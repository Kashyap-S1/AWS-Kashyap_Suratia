# Project-AWS-Kashyap_Suratia

Used unsupervivsed learning and Amazon SageMaker skills to cluster cryptocurrencies and created plots to present results and complete following tasks.


Data Preprocessing: Prepared data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.


Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: Reduced data dimension using the PCA algorithm from sklearn.


Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means: Predicted clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the KMeans algorithm from sklearn.


Visualizing Results: Created some plots and data tables to present my results.


 Deployed notebook to Amazon SageMaker.
